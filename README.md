# processmaker
GLPI plugin that provides an interface with ProcessMaker (http://www.processmaker.com/).  
Is currently compatible to GLPI 0.83.8 and ProcessMaker 2.5, 2.8 and 3.0 (see note below)  
Note: for ProcessMaker 3.0, this plugin can run old (2.x) and new (3.x) processes, but the process map view (for new BMPN process) has a bug.
